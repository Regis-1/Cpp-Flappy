# Cpp-Flappy
A simple clone of Flappy Bird made on original game engine created with C++ and SDL library.\
**It is a Visual Studio project, so this IDE is necessary to build it and run it!**

### Key bindings:
- _SPACEBAR_ - Jump
- _R_ - Reset/Retry after collision
- _ESC_ - Quit the game in any moment
